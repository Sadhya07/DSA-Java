# DSA-Java

This repository contains my personal practice code for mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.

###  Folder Structure
Each folder/topic represents a key concept or data structure in DSA, such as:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Recursion
- Binary Search
- HashMaps, HashSets
- Backtracking
- OOPs in Java

###  Purpose
This repository was created as part of my learning journey for **placements and competitive programming**. It includes:
- Well-commented code for understanding
- Hands-on problem solving
- My personal notes and explanations as comments for revision

### Note
> Some comments may be written informally or in Hinglish â€“ they are my personal notes to make concepts easier for me to remember.
